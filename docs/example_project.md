# Blog Platform Project

We want to build a modern blog platform that allows users to create and manage their own blogs. The platform should support multiple users, each with their own blog. Users should be able to write posts, categorize them, and allow readers to comment on posts.

Key features:
1. User registration and authentication
2. Ability to create and edit blog posts with a rich text editor
3. Categorization of posts with tags
4. Comment system for readers
5. Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
6. Search functionality across all blogs
7. Admin dashboard for managing content and users
